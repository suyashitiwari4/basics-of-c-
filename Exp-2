OUTPUT:
Enter any integer: 5
Integer = 5 and size is 4 bytes
Enter any number with decimal: 6.8
Float = 6.8 and size is 4 bytes
Enter any word: suyashi
Srting = suyashi and size is 32 bytes
Enter any number with bigger decimal: 6.89757
Double = 7.87263e-85 and size is 8 bytes
Enter any character: @
Character = @ and size is 1 bytes
Enter True/False: 0
Boolean = 0 and size is 1 bytes
