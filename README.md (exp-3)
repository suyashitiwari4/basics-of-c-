Aim: 1.To find wether the given number is positive or negative.
     2.To calculate average and grade of a student of 5 subjects.
     3.To find the quadrants of a given point.
Theory:
     1.We used if, else if and else statement.In this if the given number is greater than 0 then it is positive,if the given
       number is less than 0 then it is negative otherwise it is 0.
       
     2.In this case first we find the average of marks of 5 subjects by avg=(m1+m2+m3+m4+m5)/5. Then we us if ,else if and else
      statement.If avg is greater than equal top 90 then the grade is O,if it is greater than equal to 80 and less than 90 then
      the grade is A+,if it is greater than equal to 70 and less than 80 then the grade is B+, if it is greater than equal to 60 
      and less than 70 ,then the grade is C+,if it is greater than equal to 50 and less than 40 then the grade  is D,else the grade
      is F.

    3.In this we take 2 points x and y.If x and y both are positive then the point lies on 1 st quadrant,if x is negative and y is 
     positive then the point lies on 2nd quadrant, if x and y both are negative then point lies on 3rd quadrant ,if x is positive and 
     y is negaative then the point lies on 4th quadrant else the point is origin.
Result:
     Hence , we learned to find wether the given number is positive or negative,to calculate average and grade of a student of 5 subjects
     and to find the quadrants of a given point.
