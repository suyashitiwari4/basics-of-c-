EXP-1(PROGRAM 1& 2)
AIM: To print hello world and to create a calculator
APPARATUS: online c++ compiler.
PROCEDURE 1:
●	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.
●	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.
●	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.
●	The next line cout << "Hello World"; causes the message "Hello World" to be displayed on the screen.
●	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
PROCEDURE 2:
●	The C++ language defines several headers, which contain information that is either necessary or useful to your program. For this program, the header <iostream> is needed.
●	The line using namespace std; tells the compiler to use the std namespace. Namespaces are a relatively recent addition to C++.
●	The line int main() is the main function where program execution begins.
●       We take two numbers as input and perform addition ,subtraction ,multiplication and division.
●	The next line return 0; terminates main( )function and causes it to return the value 0 to the calling process.
RESULT:
Hence we learned to print hello world and to create a calculator.
